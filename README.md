# Squash Bug Website
Our team has built a web application that tracks bugs in software by prioritizing and assigning them to team members. The website allows users to login and manage bugs in their software, including adding, removing, and resolving bugs. I used react app to create our website and mongo database with chakra ui for back end part.

## Features
- User authentication: users can login to manage bugs specific to their software.
- Bug tracking: users can add, remove, and resolve bugs in their software.
- Priority assignment: users can assign a priority level to each bug to indicate its importance.
- Assignment to team members: users can assign bugs to team members to manage and resolve.
- Simple and intuitive user interface.
- Use dekstop for best experience.
